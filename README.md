### Introduction :
Membership inference attack tries to find a data point's membership in a training dataset. 
It predicts whether a data point was present in the dataset used to train a model. It can help to leak valuable information
from a ML model. This attack is a major threat to machine learning Api present in the market. This attack take adavantage of
overfit in the model. To know more about this refer 
This project is implementation of this paper [ML Leaks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.01246.pdf).
